I am a first year Math student at the University of Washington. I am currently learning complex analysis, group theory, and playing around with some graph theory. Outside of math I enjoy working out, being outside, spending time with my 3 dogs, and Star Wars. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). 

Here you can find my instagram too (https://www.instagram.com/austinulrigg/?hl=en).

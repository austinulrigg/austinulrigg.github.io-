I am a first year Math student at the University of Washington. I am taking Complex Analysis, Modern Algebra, and [MATH563](https://math.washington.edu/courses/2024/spring/math/563/a) Outside of math, I enjoy working out, being outside, spending time with my 3 dogs, and Star Wars. 

Here's an invite to past study groups I've led in [complex analysis using Stein & Shakarchi](https://discord.gg/AgRT6ZFC) and [real analysis using Follands Adv. Calculus](https://discord.gg/fwn8gEEH). 

Here you can find my instagram too [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/austinulrigg/?hl=en).
